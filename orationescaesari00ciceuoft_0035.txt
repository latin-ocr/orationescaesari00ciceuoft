of Rom-n citizenship, provided that, at the time the law wa<
passed, he had a. domicile in Italy ; and that, within sixty days,
he‘ ‘g· we in his name* ‘to one of the praetors. Archi-is at ‹nce

When the next census w as taken (Β. C. 813), Archias u as absent
from Rome, and, consequently, Ιιί.» mnne wax omitted frum tlte
censor-'s list.

Takiug advantage of this fact, one GRATIUS. who is otherwise
unknown, brought an action against Archias of having illegally
assumed the franchise, and, under the law above referred to,
claimed that he should be expelled from Rome.

GRATIUS urged (1) that no documentary evidence existed of his
enrolment as a citizen of Heraclea ; and (2) that his name did
not appear on the Roman burgess—roll at any subsequent period.

CICERO replied (1) that Archias had been enrolled as a citizen
of Heraclea, as was proved by her citizens and by Lucullus,
though the documencs in question could not be produced, since tlte
archiv-es of Heraclea laad been destroyed by! Jire ,· (2) that his client
resided in Italy when. the laus was enacted; (3) that within the
sixty days specified lte had presented liis name to tlte prator, as
the record sufficiently showed.

The mere question of law furnished little scope for Cicero's
eloquence‚ and he devmed the major part of his speech to praises
of the humanizing effects of literary culture, adding a eulogy on
the genius of Archias. The oration, therefore, is interesting·
rather from a Iiterary than a legal point of view, while its popu—
larity is due principally to the chapters which set forth the
advantages of a liberal education.

The result of the trial and the subsequent career of Archias
are unknown, but we may reasonably suppose that Cicero's
pleading prevailed.
