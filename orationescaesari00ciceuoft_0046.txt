Quas idem dicis, ‘⁴ which you yourself say ;” a remark made by
Gratius concerning the records of Metellus.

Idem=ipse‚ following tu, as subject of (licis. H. 451, 3.

So qaum dit-uc, ncyac idem, “though he asserts, yet he (the same)
deniesst’- -Cicero,

9. An domzctliunz, etc.‚ ‘⁴ had he not his domicile at Rome?'‘
Some editions give “At domicilium in Italia,'' etc„ “but (you
will say) he had not his domicile in Italy,'’ anticipating an objec-
tion of Gratius. In Italia, as given in chap. 4, appears more in
harmony with the evident requirement of the law in question.

citizenship, and connected with the board (college) of praetors,
have the authority of public records,⁷’ i.e.‚ of all the records
made at that tiine by the several praetors, those of Q. Metellus
alone were trustworthy. The registers of Appius and Gabinius
are next contrasted with those of Metellus.

be kept too carelessly, and whereas the disreputableness (frivolity)
of Gabinius, as long as he was uncondemncd, and his utter ruin
after his impeachment, took away all credit from lais tables;
Metellus (on the otho} hand), a man the most just and most
scrupulous of all, was characterized by so much carefulness (in
his official ‹luties), that hc came to L. Lentullus, the praetor, and
the judges, and said that he was much disturbed (affected) by the
erasure of a single name.”

Appii, probably A. C. Pulcher. father of Cicero's enemy: P.
Clodius.
