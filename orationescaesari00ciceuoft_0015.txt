tavius, at the instigation of Antony, allowed Oicero’s
name to be placed on the fatal proscription list. The
soldiers of Antony were soon started in pursuit. They
overtook Cicero near Formiae, where his head was sev-
ered from his body by the bravo Popilius. The hands
were cut off, and the murderers carried them, with
the head, to Antony, who caused them (in mockery of
his triumphs in eloquence,) to be nailed to the rostra ς

Antonius, pierced with her needle the tongue which
had dared to declaim against) both her husbands.
Thus, in the sixby-fourth year of his age, perishcd
Cicero, a man who will ever sband pre-eminent as a
specimen of the highest moral and intellectual culture.
