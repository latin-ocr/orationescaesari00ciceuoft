6 LIFE OF· CICERO.

practical eloquencc in the Forum; at the same time
he pursued the study of Roman law and rhetoric with
such success that in his twenty-first year he wrote a
work on rhetoric, a portion of which is still extant.
[n his twenty-sixth year, amply prepared, he entered
upon his career as a public orator. He distinguished
himself in it, almost without interruption‚ down to
his death, ‹lisplaying his skill and talent in the most
varied circumstances, and standing forth as the greatest
orator among his contemporaries, “ the most consum·
mate specimen of the Roman character under the in-
fluence of Hcllcnic culturc.''

His orations, fifty-six of which have come down to
us, arc the mirror of his politica] career, and of the
most important events of his life ; they are, moreover,
the most brilliant monuments of Latin prose. “ The
fulncss and harmony of his thoughts, the masterly
manner and clearness with which he handles his sub-
jects, the transparency and variety of forms, the over-
flowing and brilliant rhetorical diction, and the simple,
unaffected narrative—-all these qualities excite our
admiration, and are found combined in each of his
orations. The extant orations form only the smalle1
part of his literary productions; we have, besides,
a number of rhetorical ancl philosophical writings, and
an cxceedingly rich collection of letters.''——Zumpl.
