PREFACE.

 

In the preparation of this work, the special requirements 01
the University classes and Intermediate Examinations of our
High Schools and Collegiate Institutes, have been kept in view.

Accompanying the notes is given a short analysis of the
argument, which, it is hoped, will aid the student in more
clearly understanding the uranon.

For the purposes of explanation and issustration, nequent
reference is made to the grammar, an industrious use of which
will tend to secure a familiarity with the general and idio-
matic structure of the language.

In regard to collater-al matter given in connection witi: :he
biographical sketeh‚ and the “Imitative Exercises ’' following
the notes, while they have been found useful in class-work,
they are not intended to supersede that subsidiary instruction
which the cxperiencc of every good te: ch r will suggest.

Trusting that the book may prove serviceable in the pre-
paration of this favorite oration, the editor commenda it to
tho consideration of his co-laboms.
